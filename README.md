# Week 7 Again Part 2

Wwhat do we want to happen to our box when we click the button

if the button is visible we want it hidden,else we want it to to be revealed

You gotta make the new user control

we are going to add new buttons

1 create a new user control,name of my choice

2 add 2 new buttons to our main window xaml

3 add fucntionality
	when you click one button it will show one user control
	when you click the other it will show the second user control
You should have no default user controls in your developer window
